learning how xml is different from html


How do you think XML relates to HTML?

    XML is like HTML because they both use tags. They are different because XML lets you use any kind of tag you want whereas HTML has a set of prescribed tags.

What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
    One of the benefits is that XML allows for better readability of the code.
    Another benefit is that it makes it easier to find the information you are looking for in XML by being more searchable.

What are some disadvantages?
    I'm not sure what the disadvantages are of XML, but if I had to guess I would say that the structure is less defined which opens things up to becoming less organized or more confusing if the coder doesn't organize things properly.
